When i was about 7 years old i finally moved into a house and i've now been living there for about 8 or 9 years. From 1st to 5th grade i went to <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/gbrier/"> Greenbrier Elementary</a>. For middle school i went to Hillcrest in 6th and then Beck Acaedmy in 7th and 8th. </p>

<p>My family loves to go on road trips. Once we all went to Orlando, florida for a week and we stayed in this huge house with a jacuzzi in the back and a pool. We went to disneyland walked around and saw some cool stuff and went out to eat. We even went to the office and they had games there like a tennis table and a pool table and we played. <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/"> Disneyland</a>.</p>

<p>A Few months ago i went up to Charlotte with my aunties because we were going to go to the waterpark. We stayed in my other aunts apartment who already lives in charlotte overnight. The next morning we drove almost a hour to the greensboro Wet n' Wild water park. It was a blast, we rode almost every ride and some were really dark and scary. We mostly stayed on the wave ride and jumped the waves and swam through them. We ate lunch there too and relaxed. </p>
